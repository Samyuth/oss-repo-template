## Part 3

It is important to chose a license so you can make sure that your software is not used in ways you would not like. It makes it clear to other contributers or anyone who would like to extend the software what they can and cannot do with it. It also clarifies for end users how they can use and distribute the software.

## Part 4

If a project does not have a license it can not really be considered open source. This is because all rights are reserved by the creators. Legally you are not protected if you modify the code. The creator of the project is within their rights to hold you liable for any such actions.

## Part 5

I agree with the article. It seems as though a major reason that gopher failed is taht it was not accepted by the community, and it did not have as many resources. Both of these problems as the article argues can be fixed by more closely following an open source model. Open sourcing allows for development by a larger community and also allows for vital feedback from various users.

## Part 6

The reason .NET core is open source is because microsoft sees the potential for development and adoption of the framework on various platforms as detailed in [this](https://www.cio.com/article/243178/the-real-reason-microsoft-open-sourced-net.html) article. Essentialy microsoft is looking to utilize community driven development to expand the product. The reason the license is permissive is because historically the .NET framework has had proprietary uses so Microsoft does not want to punish any companies using that technology.
