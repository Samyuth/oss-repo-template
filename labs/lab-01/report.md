## Reading

### How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way

1. In my experience it is better to communicate the process for how you arrive at the answer. Even if you have not figured out the entire answer this allows others to build of your input or even the original person who asked to arrive at a better answer. By communicating the process you are also helping the asker figure out other strategies to approach the question.
2. Give links to helpful resources. If the question is hard enough there is a good chance that there are really good resources that take a while to find so it is better to just present these resources for future reference.

### Free Culture

I think the reading higlights the importance of making sure you understand the legal implications of technology that you are working on. It's especially scary because it would appear he wasn't even technically sued for making the changes to the engine, he was sued for actually deploying it. It was not stated in the chapter but it would seem as though based on the fact that they sued Jesse and not students who had worked on prior iterations that this software was not licensed properly. If it had been perhaps the blame would be more evenly distributed across different parties Microsoft among them causing a bigger stir. This is all speculative but it does show that simple steps can be taken that may at least help in these cases. I also think it is important to make sure you are engaged with a community that can support you in these situations. Apparently Jesse was able to raise all the money he lost back later through contributions on a personal website. There was also a good deal of public awareness in the form of news stories and articles. The book itself was actually written and published within a couple of years of the incident and that type of awareness hopefully will help in making it so such incidents don't occur again.

## Reflection

The project that I think would be interesting to work on is called Textractor. Recently I have started to get into visual novels which are essentially novels with sound and images in the form of a game, with the games often including branching storylines depending on choices taken. A problem with these games is that a lot of them are in Japanese which is where Textractor comes in. Unlike other translation software which uses OCR, "optical character recognition" this directly intercepts API calls made by the game to the operating sytem to get the exact text. I was actually prototyping a utility to essentially create a map of the choices in a visual novel and was going to use this software to extend it's functionality. I could however do it vice versa so that I make an extension for the app which essentially maps choices as you go. This project does not currently seem to active which may pose a problem but I also think there is a large enough community and userbase where I could get support. An additional difficulty is that the entire project is in c++ which I can get used to but will require a little more time though I do have a lot of prototyping done in my personal project so it's a matter of figuring out how to write the extension.
